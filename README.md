    Practicing some of the fundamentals of Nextjs v13.

 - File-Based Routing. 
- How routing works in Next.js 
- How page files are connected in different components
- How single dynamic routes work
- Mix react feature with Next
- useRouter hook to access to router or get data via url
- Static Generation: Pre-generate during build time.
  Pages are Prepared before deploying
 export async function getStaticProps(context){..} helps Nextjs know which data to access to pre-generate a page.
 async returns a promise and runs any code that runs server-side code only. This code will not be included in the code bundle sent back to your client, which is good for protecting data.
